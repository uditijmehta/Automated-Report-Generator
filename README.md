### Description
This project is a Simplified Report Generator designed for web developers. It automates the process of parsing data from a database and generating a user-friendly report in HTML format. The tool emphasizes ease of use, readability, and efficient data presentation.

### Features
- Automated data parsing from CSV files.
- Generation of interactive, visually appealing charts using Plotly.
- Conversion of data into a neatly formatted HTML report.
- Interactive elements for enhanced report navigation.
- Basic error handling for file reading.

### Technology Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Plotly
- HTML/CSS

### Installation

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
   - Installation of Pandas and Plotly:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas plotly
     ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using:
     ```bash
     git clone [repository URL]
     ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Change directory to the cloned repository:
     ```bash
     cd [local directory]
     ```

### Usage Instructions

1. **Preparing Your Data:**
   - Place your CSV files in the designated folders within the project directory.

2. **Running the Application:**
   - Execute the main script to generate the report:
     ```bash
     python reports.py
     ```
   - This will create an HTML file named `report_output.html` in your project directory.

3. **Viewing the Report:**
   - Open the generated `report_output.html` file in any web browser to view the report.

### Testing

- Run the test suite to ensure everything is functioning correctly:
  ```bash
  python -m unittest
  ```

### Documentation
